//                Robert,
//                The code block creates a room object if there is next line
//                to process in RoomsRef.txt file. Then, it proceeds to read
//                the room id and store it in the variable roomID.
//                Next it moves on to the next line and save the data in that
//                line as the room name in the variable roomName.Then, it goes
//                to the next line and retrieves the description. It is stored
//                in the variable roomDescription. The program stores this information,
//                which is why you see output without any text being printed.
//
//                This while loop runs as long as the file has more lines to read, inside the loop.
//
//                Next thing to do:  You need to create another loop which will
//                read in lines of Exits as connection between rooms. Each exit
//                object includes a direction and a room Id as destination.
//                you will need to add those two separate information to
//                Room object by creating method such as addExits as a parameter
//                in the Room object.
//
//
//                        Thatâ€™s the next task.
